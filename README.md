# Unsupervised Machine Learning Implementation Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of various unsupervised machine learning algorithms using Python and the `scikit-learn` library. The primary focus is on clustering techniques such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.

## 📚 Algorithms Used

- **K-Means Clustering**  
  Groups data points into K clusters based on Euclidean distance.

- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**  
  Clusters data based on density and identifies noise/outliers.

- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
  Builds nested clusters using a bottom-up (agglomerative) approach.

## 📊 Dataset

- Example datasets are generated or loaded from `sklearn.datasets`
- Features are standardized using `StandardScaler` before clustering

## 🔍 Features

- Data visualization with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Preprocessing with `StandardScaler`
- Clustering and evaluation of results
- Comparison between clustering techniques

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pandas
- numpy
